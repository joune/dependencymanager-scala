# ScalaDM

This is a draft scala API for managing OSGi service components and dependencies based on Felix's [dependencymanager](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-dependency-manager.html)

It's a scaled down version, in terms of features; just a place for my own "proof of concept", the goal being to make a more typesafe and more fluent DependencyManager API.

View tests for sample usage.
